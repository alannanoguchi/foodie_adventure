## Purpose of this Project: 
**To create a webscraper for the website: https://www.zabihah.com/**

My go-to app for finding places to eat is Yelp. It's a pretty easy to use app but one problem that I've encountered is finding Halal places to eat.
For this reason, I searched for Halal Restaurant Websites and came across Zabihah. What I love most about this website is that it provides a "Halal Summary"
of the place to help verify that it is Halal.
