I will be further implementing the makescraper project to create: Foodie Adventures: Halal Edition. The purpose of this project is to help people find halal places to eat. It'll allow users to keep the restaurants in a list named after each City. 

Example:
<h1>California</h1>

<h2> Sacramento </h2>
<div>1. KB Thai Hut 2. Ariana's Kabob and Gyro </div>

<h2> Davis </h2>
<div>1. Halal Guys </div>
